    "### 1.1. Problem Description\n",
    "In this section we replicate the allocation example provided in the paper. The problem we want to tackle is to allocate a flow of $N$ refugees to $M$ localities. Refugees arrive sequentially, and need to be processed (and assigned) as they arrive. \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown by Bansak et al. (2018) and Trapp et al. (2018), individual refugees can have different probabilities of integrating in different localities. We coarsen these probabilities into a binary indicator. That is, every refugee can be either *acceptable* or *non-acceptable* for a given locality. We indicate acceptability in the refugee flows by a N$\\times$M matrix, where each row represents a refugee and each column a locality. This matrix will be populated by a binary variable (0/1) indicating acceptability. We call this matrix **scoring matrix**, or ``scores``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Localities might be subject to capacity constraints, or might be of different sizes and thus subject to a quotas system. The algorithm can accomodate these constraints trough a 1$\\times$M **quotas vector**, or ``quotas``. This vector is a series of integers, denoting the maximum number of refugees that can be assigned to each locality $m$.\n",

    "We define the scoring matrix as in the example, and call the assignment function"
